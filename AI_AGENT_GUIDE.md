## üß† AI Agent Capabilities

### 1. Data Quality Analysis

#### What it analyzes:
- **Data completeness**: Percentage of valid data points
- **Outlier detection**: Identification of statistical outliers
- **Distribution analysis**: Skewness and normality assessment
- **Quality scoring**: Overall data quality metric

#### Example Output:
```
Quality Score: 87.3%

‚úÖ Strengths:
‚Ä¢ Good data completeness: 95.2%
‚Ä¢ Low outlier ratio: 2.1%
‚Ä¢ Reasonable distribution skewness: 1.23

‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings:
‚Ä¢ Highly skewed distribution: 1.23

üí° Recommendations:
‚Ä¢ Consider using KDE instead of lognormal distribution
```

### 2. Intelligent Parameter Recommendations

#### What it recommends:
- **Workflow type**: 2-step vs 3-step based on data size
- **Step sizes**: Optimal clone numbers for each step
- **Distribution method**: Lognormal vs KDE based on data characteristics
- **Simulation settings**: Repetitions and correlation step size

#### Example Output:
```
Workflow: 2-step workflow
Distribution Method: lognormal
Step Sizes: {'step1_keep': 96, 'step2_keep': 48, 'step3_keep': 6}

Reasoning:
‚Ä¢ Medium dataset (1000-2000 clones) - 2-step workflow is efficient
‚Ä¢ Moderate skewness (1.23) - Lognormal suitable
‚Ä¢ Criteria columns detected: 1 - consider using filtering
```

### 3. Results Analysis

#### What it analyzes:
- **Performance level**: Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor classification
- **Key insights**: Important findings from your results
- **Optimization opportunities**: Areas for improvement
- **Risk assessments**: Potential issues to address

#### Example Output:
```
Performance Level: Good

Key Insights:
‚Ä¢ Good performance: 67.3% success rate
‚Ä¢ Moderate optimal correlation (0.58) - reasonable assay consistency
‚Ä¢ Low improvement potential: 12.4% range

Optimization Opportunities:
‚Ä¢ Room for improvement through parameter optimization
```

### 4. Interactive Chat Interface

#### Supported Query Types:
- **Help queries**: "How does correlation work?"
- **Optimization queries**: "How can I improve my results?"
- **Explanation queries**: "What does success probability mean?"
- **Recommendation queries**: "What parameters should I use?"

#### Example Conversations:
```
User: "How can I improve my results?"
AI: "Your current performance is good. I recommend: 1) Focus on high-sensitivity parameters, 2) Test different correlation ranges, 3) Consider step size adjustments."

User: "What does correlation mean?"
AI: "Correlation between 0-1 measures assay consistency. 0.7+ means strong consistency, 0.5 means moderate, <0.3 means weak consistency."
```
